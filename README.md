# multiblock

## Overview

Multiblock is a multi-purpose DApp which allows users to easily mint custom ERC-20 tokens as well as Escrow Contracts.
This is achieved through the use of Token and Escrow factories, which also power the backend of the application, which fully relies on the Ethereum blockchain rather than a traditional backend.
